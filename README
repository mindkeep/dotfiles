# dotfiles

## Overview

This project seeks to provide a somewhat unified environment, regardless of
whether I'm running on bash, zsh, ksh, or even dash/sh on Linux, Solaris, or
OSX. zsh is where most of my work is done and is most feature rich.

## *sh env files

The various .*shrc, .*profile, and .*logout files are sh specific and primarily
responsible for setting up the prompt for each shell. Each of these will also
source .shrc.common and .shrc.local (if present, not in this repo). The
.shrc.common and .shrc.local files should be written POSIX shell so that they
are portable to to the other *sh implementations.

## misc other files

.vim and .vimrc - Live and die by vi

.screenrc - tweaked for zsh, but other settings may be interesting to people

.Xdefaults - seems to be mostly ignored these days, but common enough that I
included it

.xinitrc - most display managers will ignore this, but if you ever run startx
from a vt, this might be useful
